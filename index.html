    <h1>schools kills the creativity</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>1) Every human have a God gifted capabilities for creativity.</p>
        <p> 2) We have no idea what's going to happen, in terms of the future.</p>
     <p>3) Every human have a individual difference.</p>
     <h2>Facts about the children</h2>
     <hr>
     <p>1) Kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. They're not
        frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same
        thing as being creative.</p>
        <p>2) If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything
            original. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that
            capacity.</p>
            <p>3) They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies
                like this. We stigmatize mistakes.</p>
                <p>4) And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the
                    worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out
                    of their creative capacities.</p>
                    <p>4) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them
                        progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And
                        slightly to one side.</p>
                        <h2>today's education system</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>1) The education system is one of the most important things in any country. Only the
                            country that educates its kids properly has a chance of a truly great future. However, in
                            most countries today, all that the school systems do is to prepare their students to fit into
                            the current system.But is that real education? Curbing all the natural interests and
                            creativity in a child and making all ofthem identical to each other is not fair.</p>
                            <p>2) Schools are not developing creative minds but turning millions of people into robots.
                                They do not realize that how many kids relate to that fish swimming up stream in class
                                never finding that gives thinking they are stupid believing they are useless. They are
                                killing the creativity, individuality and inequality of children.</p>
                                <p>3) In literary more than a century, nothing has changed in our education system and yet
                                    they claim to prepare students for the future.</p>
